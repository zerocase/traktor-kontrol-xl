# Traktor Kontrol XL

## Introduction

Traktor Kontrol XL is a custom mapping for Traktor Pro 3 designed to give as much control possible to the user while still using all 4 Decks and 4 Insert FX available on Traktor.
With this mapping the Launch Control XL is transformed into a capable, compact and budget friendly 4 Deck DJ controller.

### Getting started

After downloading follow these steps:

- Open **Traktor Pro 3**
- Click on **File** > **Controller Manager...**
- Under "Device Setup" click on **Add...** > **Import TSI**  > **Import Other**
- In the new window navigate to location where you downloaded TraktorKontrolXL.tsi 
- Select it and click **Open**
- Make sure that the In-Port and Out-Port are both set to the Launch Control XL

In the same preferences window you can configure Traktor to work with 4 Decks and 4 FX:

- Click on **Decks Layout** in the Preferences list on the left
- Under "Deck Flavor" set all of the dropdowns to **Track Deck**
- Under "Deck Layout" set the Decks dropdown to **4 Decks**, the Size will depend on the screen real estate that you have, I keep it on **Advanced**
- Click on **Effects**  in the Preferences list
- Under "FX Unit Routing" Toggle from **2 FX Units** to **4 FX Units**
- Set all of the FX dropdowns to **Insert**
- Under "FX Panel Mode" set all of the dropdowns to **Single**

Now you should be fully set up with the custom mapping and can jump right into mixing!

## Layout overview

This layout splits the controller in half to control different aspects of the software.
**Primary Controls** and **Secondary Controls**.

### Primary Controls

Each column in this half gives you controls for every deck as shown below:

These knobs, sliders and buttons offer you control to the EQs, Volume, Play and Cue.

### Secondary Controls

In this half there are two modes you can switch between, **"Utility mode"** and **"Effects mode"**.
You can switch between them by  pressing the left Track Select button to switch to **"Effects mode"** and the right one to switch to **"Utility mode"**.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Utility mode

Lets look at **"Utility mode"**:
This mode is similar to the Primary Controls in its layout as shown below:


![SecondaryControls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32014360/226222275-2aeaf422-a00d-44fe-8370-338f35ce81bb.png)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
However in this case, they allow you control to the Gain, Filter, Pitch, Tempo,  Filter on/off and a button to return to the original tempo.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### FX Mode
"FX Mode" allows you control to the 4 FX that are available in Traktor.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

With this mode you can control all of the FX parameters for each effect, the Dry/Wet as well as a button to toggle it on/off and lastly the FX select which will scroll through the FX list.
